## Learning plan and priorities

Focus on the 🔴 red-rated topics first to fill in the gaps in your knowledge. After completing those, expand the learning plan below to list and research the 🟠 amber-rated topics at your convenience.

### 1. Git and GitHub

- I have basic knowledge of the common Git commands. At least enough to allow me to do pair programming at the School of Code (SOC).
- However, I lack knowledge of Git merge conflict resolution.
- I also lack knowledge of the proper Git/GitHub flow that developers use daily (to avoid and fix merge conflicts).

### 2. Async JavaScript and JavaScript promises

- I have a basic understanding of asynchronous JavaScript and JavaScript promises, but I struggle to retrieve values/data from resolved promises.
- I need to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of JavaScript promises and what they return when they resolve, reject, or error out.
- And how to access the values/data inside those resolved/rejected/errored promises.

### 3. Async/Await

- I understand the basic concepts behind async/await asynchronous JavaScript functions.
- However, I struggle to write proper syntax and use promise chaining inside async/await functions.
- And again, accessing the values/data returned by these "promisified" async/await functions does not come naturally at present.
